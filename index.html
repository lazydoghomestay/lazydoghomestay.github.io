							Khrystian Finelli O. Altuna – ★★★★★ <br/>
								“A home away from home. <br/>
								This place suits everyone who wants comfort and serenity. <br/>
								The owners are very welcoming and friendly. <br/>
								Their taste for food is recommendable; <br/>
								homemade roasted salsa is one of the bests. <br/>
								Dogs, also, could have a place to stay.”

								“This place was the BEST.  <br/>
								There was nothing bad that I can say about our stay.  <br/>
								Jason and company really took good care of us. Hospitality to the max.
								We were there a for team building. It was rainy but it didn’t matter they still made us feel at home. Imagine 21 of us in one house. It felt like the house was ours. Love their dogs too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Hopefully we can come back here when it is not stormy. Thanks for the daily supply of fresh veggies and you’re homemade salsa is the bomb!! God bless you guys. #siegenphils #teambuilding”

								“BEST HOMEY PLACE TO STAY IN BAGUIO! We had a wonderful overnight stay. The room we stayed was spacious and clean. I love the pillows and bedsheet ❤. I love the vegetable bar where you can cook breakfast. A daily supply of fresh vegetables and eggs for free; unlimited coffee- beat that!! They have pantry with complete spices/condiments too - very unique concept!!! The owner treats you like a family. The backyard has a very serene relaxing view-swing in their hammock, play their instruments such as guitar and ukulele. Cooper, the lazy white dog was very cute and sweet. You will never feel bored because they offer good entertainment such as indoor/outdoor cinema, they have ps4 gaming consoles and NETFLIX too!! Id rather stay home than roam around Baguio. Kudos!! Thanks Jane and James :-) for accomodating us. I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!”
